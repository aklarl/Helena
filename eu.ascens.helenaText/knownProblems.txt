Problems and ideas for solutions: 
=================================

Two Xtext projects in one workspace causes the following problems: 
(1) Binding Problem, when two Xtext projects exist in one workspace: 
	error message that HelenaTextScopingProvider is not bound
	--> Workaround: use 'fresh' eclipse and 'fresh' workspace
	
(2) Error when starting new runtime environment with helenaText and adaptiveHelenaText 
	plug-in: 
	When opening a helena file the helenaText editor does open with errors and does not 
	show the file

	--> Make sure that eclipse projects for all loaded plug-ins do have the same java version 
		set in the build path + 
		set the same java version/execution enviroment in the launch configuration!
